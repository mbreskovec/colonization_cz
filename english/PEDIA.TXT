into the colonies as free colonists.} 


@; *** CARGO TYPES ***

@;
@CARGO0
@width=300
^{FOOD}
Food is one of the most valuable commodities your people
produce. The survival of your colonies depends upon it. The best
places to grow food are in {plains, grasslands, prairie, and savannah.}
Plowing the land also increases food yield. {Fishing} is an excellent
source of food, and {fisheries} are particularly productive.
^
{Each colonist working inside a colony eats 2 food every turn.}

@;
@CARGO1
@width=300
^{SUGAR}
Sugar is a cash crop that can be sold in Europe for a handsome profit or
converted into {Rum} by a {distiller} for sale at a better price. 
^
{Sugar grows most abundantly in Savannah, especially in Prime Sugar 
Land.}

@;
@CARGO2
@width=300
^{TOBACCO}
Tobacco is a cash crop that can be sold in Europe for a handsome profit 
or converted into {Cigars} by a {tobacconist} for sale at a better price. 
^
{Tobacco grows most abundantly in Grassland, especially in Prime 
Tobacco Land.}

@;
@CARGO3
@width=300
^{COTTON}
Cotton is a cash crop that can be sold in Europe for a handsome profit or
converted into {Cloth} by a {weaver} for sale at a better price. 
^
{Cotton grows most abundantly in Prairie, especially in Prime Cotton 
Land.}

@;
@CARGO4
@width=300
^{FURS}
Fur is abundant in the Americas and there is a hungry market for it 
in Europe. Your {fur traders} can convert furs into coats for an even 
greater profit. {Woodlands} of all sorts are good for trapping, but 
even better are {game and beaver} squares in colder climates. 
Additionally, a {road} in a forest square increases fur output.
^
{Fur is found most abundantly in all forested areas, but especially in 
colder terrains where there is Beaver.}


@;
@CARGO5
@width=300
^{LUMBER}
Lumber is one of the most valuable commodities you can produce. Your
{carpenters} need lumber to build {buildings, ships, artillery, and
fortifications.} Lumber is collected whenever your pioneers clear a
forested square or when you have lumberjacks working the forests.
^
{Woodland of all sorts is good for wood cutting, and roads in forests 
and Prime Timber increase lumber production.}

@;
@CARGO6
@width=300
^{ORE}
Ore is one of your most useful resources. It can be sold in Europe or 
converted into {tools} by your {blacksmiths.} Tools may then be changed 
into {guns,} by {gunsmiths.}
^
{Ore is found in hills, mountains, and swamps.} 

@;
@CARGO7
@width=300
^{SILVER}
Silver is one of the most valuable metals found in the New 
World. Silver can be mined from {mountain} squares, and some native 
civilizations have it in great quantity.
^
{Silver is found in mountains, but these abundant sources will soon run 
dry if mined.}

@;
@CARGO8
@width=300
^{HORSES}
Horses are useful for aiding travel in the New World. {Scouts and 
Dragoons} move significantly faster than do colonists on foot.  {Any 
colonist} may be mounted to create {scouts} and {any soldier} can be 
mounted to create {dragoons.}
^
{Horses can be obtained only in Europe,} but once brought over, they 
may be bred. If you have {two or more horses} in a colony and {extra food} 
stored in your warehouse, your colony will {produce more horses}. If you
construct stables, your horses will breed twice as fast.

@;
@CARGO9
@width=300
^{RUM}
Rum is the product of sugar processing in a distillery. It is usually of 
much greater monetary value than raw sugar.
^
{Any colonist working as a distiller can convert sugar into rum.}

@;
@CARGO10
@width=300
^{CIGARS}
Cigars are the product of tobacco processing in a tobacconist's house or 
shop. Cigars are usually of much greater monetary value than raw 
tobacco.
^
{Any colonist working as a tobacconist can convert tobacco into cigars.}

@;
@CARGO11
@width=300
^{CLOTH}
Cloth is the product of cotton processing in a weaver's house or shop. It 
is usually of much greater monetary value than raw cotton.
^
{Any colonist working as a weaver can convert cotton into cloth.}

@;
@CARGO12
@width=300
^{COATS}
Coats are made from fur in a fur trader's house or shop. They are 
usually of much greater monetary value than unprocessed pelts.
^
{Any colonist working as a fur trader can convert fur into coats.}

@;
@CARGO13
@width=300
^{TRADE GOODS}
Trade Goods can be obtained only in Europe or from other European 
settlements. These represent manufactured goods such as small tools, 
jewelry, and clothing, which the Indians may want to trade for. Most 
native tribes will gladly take trade goods, at least at first.

@;
@CARGO14
@width=300
^{TOOLS}
Tools are fundamental to successful colonial endeavors. You need tools to 
create {pioneers,} and only pioneers can {build roads, clear forests, and 
plow fields.} Additionally, tools are necessary to complete many 
{buildings} you construct inside your colonies. Finally, tools are 
converted into muskets by {gunsmiths.}
^
{Tools may be bought in Europe or manufactured by blacksmiths, who 
convert ore into tools.}

@;
@CARGO15
@width=300
^{MUSKETS}
Muskets are necessary for defense of your colonies and for building a 
substantial military force. You need muskets to create soldier
units. {Any colonist} may be given muskets to create {soldiers} and {any 
scout} may be given muskets to create {dragoons.} 
^
{Muskets may be purchased in Europe or manufactured at an armory, 
magazine, or arsenal.} Any colonist working as a gunsmith can convert 
tools into muskets.


@;
@;      *** UNIT TYPES ***
@;

@;
@UNIT0
@width=300
^{COLONISTS}
These represent the various people that come to the New World. A single 
colonist in the game represents a number of people in real life, perhaps 
100-200. There are four general types of colonists, each with different 
capabilities: petty criminals, indentured servants, free colonists, and 
specialists. Any of these colonists can do any job available in the 
settlement, but the experts do their particular jobs very well.
^
Another type exists: Indian Converts. These represent Native Americans 
that join your settlements and become colonists. They're very effective at 
outdoors jobs, but are little suited for manufacturing.

@;
@UNIT1
@width=300
^{SOLDIERS}
Soldiers are created when you give a colonist {muskets.} A 
soldier may become a {veteran} as a result of winning battles or of 
education in a {college}. Additionally, {Expert soldiers (veterans)} may 
immigrate to the New World from Europe upon occasion, and may be hired 
from the {Royal University.} 

@;
@UNIT2
@width=300
^{PIONEERS}
Pioneer units are created when you give a colonist {tools.} 
Pioneers have several important functions: they {clear woods, plow 
fields, and build roads.} In general, {Hardy Pioneers} perform their tasks 
faster than ordinary colonists working as pioneers.

@;
@UNIT3
@width=300
^{MISSIONARIES}
A missionary may be created at any site where there is a {church or 
cathedral.} This may be on the {Docks of Europe} or in a colony where a 
church or cathedral has been built. Missionaries perform the following 
important special functions: {create missions in native settlements} to 
counteract Indian anger; {denounce another European's mission} in a 
native settlement (which can result in the destruction of that mission), 
or {incite Indians to attack} another European power. {Jesuit 
Missionaries are particularly effective at these tasks.}

@;
@UNIT4
@width=300
^{DRAGOONS}
Dragoons are {soldiers mounted on horseback,} the colonial equivalent of 
cavalry. Any soldier may be converted into a dragoon if he is given horses. 
Dragoons can move farther during a turn, and they fight more effectively. 
{Veteran dragoons are more effective in battle than normal mounted 
soldiers.}

@;
@UNIT5
@width=300
^{SCOUTS}
Any colonist can become a scout if he is mounted on {horses.} Scouts 
can perform many valuable services to your cause: they {reveal} 
unexplored terrain faster, {move farther} in a turn, have better luck 
when {exploring Lost City Rumors,} can meet with and {talk to Indian 
chiefs,} {infiltrate enemy colonies} to see what's going on, and meet with 
enemy mayors in their colonies. {Seasoned scouts are better at all these 
tasks than regular colonists working as scouts.}

@;
@UNIT6
@width=300
^{REGULARS}
European regular infantry units are the Crown's regular army troops. 
They enter the game against you if you declare independence. Their only
weakness is lack of training in the rough, wilderness terrain of the New 
World.

@;
@UNIT7
@width=300
^{CONTINENTAL CAVALRY}
Continental Cavalry is one step above your veteran dragoons in combat
effectiveness. They know the backwoods, are veteran soldiers, and have 
received some military training.

@;
@UNIT8
@width=300
^{CAVALRY}
European regular cavalry units are the Crown's regular mounted soldiers.

Continental Army infantry is one step above your veteran soldiers in 
combat effectiveness. They know the backwoods, are veterans, and have 
received some regular  military training.

@;
@UNIT10
@width=300
^{TREASURE TRAIN}
This wagon train carries {plunder,} usually gold and silver, precious 
stones, and rare fabrics. Treasure trains are used to cart away the 
plunder gleaned from a native settlement or lost city. A {Galleon} is 
always required to transport the contents of a treasure train by sea.

@;
@UNIT11
@width=300
^{ARTILLERY}
Artillery may be bought in {Europe} or constructed by the armories 
within your colonies. Artillery is very effective at {attacking and 
defending colonies,} and also at attacking fortified units and Indian 
settlements. However, when defending in unprotected terrain it is 
extremely vulnerable, and when attacking there it is ineffective. An 
artillery unit that is defeated in battle is damaged and loses some of its 
firepower; if defeated again, it is destroyed.

@;
@UNIT12
@width=300
^{WAGON TRAIN}
Wagon Trains are used for hauling goods and commodities {over land.} In 
order to trade most profitably with the Indians you should enter their 
settlements with wagons full of goods. A wagon train can transport any 
cargo a ship can, except colonists and artillery. Wagons have 2 cargo 
holds and can be assigned to {trade routes.} You may never build more 
wagon trains than you have colonies.

@;
@UNIT13
@width=300
^{CARAVEL}
A Caravel is an exploration ship designed to carry a small crew 
and adequate cargo for a few months of provisions. 

@;
@UNIT14
@width=300
^{MERCHANTMAN}
A Merchantman is a medium-sized cargo ship. Its main function is to 
carry cash commodities to port for trade. It is a little larger than a 
caravel with more sail. 

@;
@UNIT15
@width=300
^{GALLEON}
A Galleon is a large cargo vessel designed for long voyages and heavy 
transport. It is as large as a ship of the line, but not armed. 

@;
@UNIT16
@width=300
^{PRIVATEER}
A Privateer is a ship owned by an individual that has obtained a "Letter of 
Marque" from his government, giving him the "right" to prey upon 
foreign shipping. Privateers can be very dangerous to your commerce 
because they observe no code of international behavior; the countries 
sponsoring them will likely claim no knowledge of their actions. 

@;
@UNIT17
@width=300
^{FRIGATE}
Frigates are dangerous gunships, capable of sinking or damaging 
enemy vessels.  

@;
@UNIT18
@width=300
^{MAN-O-WAR}
These powerful vessels appear in American waters when the War of 
Independence develops. Your mother country will send them against your 
forces, and, if foreign intervention occurs, you'll receive some to support 
your cause. They are heavily armed with cannon and capable of carrying 
large invasion forces or cargoes.

@;
@UNIT19
@width=300
^{BRAVES}
Braves are small groups of Native Americans. They represent Indians in 
their natural state, before receiving guns and horses from Europeans.

@;
@UNIT20
@width=300
^{ARMED BRAVES}
Native Americans become increasingly dangerous as they learn to use the 
deadly weapons of the Europeans. When a native tribe obtains guns from 
the Europeans, some braves will be armed with them. {This, combined 
with their knowledge of the wilderness, make them formidable opponents 
in the woods, hills, and mountains.}

@;
@UNIT21
@width=300
^{MOUNTED BRAVES}
Native American peoples did not have access to horses until the Spanish 
brought them in the late 15th century. In some cases, Indian culture 
changed considerably to incorporate the horse as a vital element. {Horses 
increase the mobility and combat power of the Indians.}

@;
@UNIT22
@width=300
^{MOUNTED WARRIORS}
Tribes that have horses and muskets are very dangerous. They are as good 
as any colonial dragoons -- even better when fighting in the wilderness.

A fur trader's shop in a colony {increases the output of coats} by any 
traders. The colony must have a {population of at least 4 } to begin 
construction of a fur trader's shop.

^{COAT FACTORY}
A fur trader's shop may be upgraded into a coat factory. A coat factory 
dramatically increases the efficiency of operations, and thus produces 
{more coats per unit of fur.} Your Continental Congress must contain 
{Adam Smith} and the {population of the colony must be at least 8} to 
begin construction of this facility.

^{CARPENTER'S SHOP}
The community builds a carpenter's shop because of the obvious need for 
constructing all sorts of items for the good of the community. A colonist 
working in a carpenter's shop {produces hammers,} which accumulate 
{to construct buildings} and structures in the settlement. Note, however, 
that the carpenter {needs lumber to create hammers.}

^{LUMBER MILL}
The humble carpenter's shop can be improved and upgraded to make those 
working there more effective. You may upgrade a carpenter's shop into 
a lumber mill when the {population of the colony reaches 3.} It {doubles 
the output of hammers} from any colonists working there (but requires 
an equal amount of lumber, of course).

^{CHURCH}
A church may be constructed almost immediately upon landing on the 
shores of the New World. The {population of a colony need only be 3.} This 
causes {increased cross production} instantly, but putting colonists to 
work in the new structure creates many more.

^{CATHEDRAL}
A church may be upgraded to a cathedral when the {population reaches 8,} 
dramatically {increasing the colony's cross production} and that of any 
colonists preaching there.

^{BLACKSMITH'S HOUSE}
The Colonial community helps build the blacksmith's house for much the 
same reasons as the carpenter's shop. They realize the need for basic 
metal goods -- tools, repairs of existing implements, and so on. {A 
colonist working in the blacksmith shop can produce tools,} which 
accumulate in the settlement's warehouse. The blacksmith {needs ore} to 
produce tools.

^{BLACKSMITH'S SHOP}
A Blacksmith's House may be expanded into a larger facility that 
{increases the production of tools.} You may begin the project when the 
colony's {population reaches 4.}

^{IRON  WORKS}
Your colonists may construct an Ironworks when the {population of the 
colony reaches 8.} It is a major facility for metal-working/production 
and dramatically {increases tool output.} The Ironworks is a factory level 
building and may not be built until {Adam Smith} joins your Continental 
Congress.
